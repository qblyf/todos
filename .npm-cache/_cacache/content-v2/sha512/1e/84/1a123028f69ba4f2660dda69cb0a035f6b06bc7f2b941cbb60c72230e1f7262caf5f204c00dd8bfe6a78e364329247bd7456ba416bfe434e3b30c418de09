If you pass `true` for this option the local hostname will be used for the via header. You can also pass a string for this option in which case that will be used for the via header.\n- `cookieRewrite`: this option can be used to support cookies via the proxy by rewriting the cookie domain to that of the proxy server. By default cookie domains are not rewritten. The `cookieRewrite` option works as the `via` option - if you pass `true` the local hostname will be used, and if you pass a string that will be used as the rewritten cookie domain.\n- `preserveHost`: When enabled, this option will pass the Host: line from the incoming request to the proxied host. Default: `false`.\n\n### Usage with route:\n\n```js\nvar proxyOptions = url.parse('https://example.com/endpoint');\nproxyOptions.route = '/api';\n\nvar middleWares = [proxy(proxyOptions) /*, ...*/];\n\n// Grunt connect uses this method\nconnect(middleWares);\n```\n","time":{"created":"2022-01-26T18:52:55.843Z","modified":"2023-08-05T13:13:23.991Z","0.15.0":"2015-10-24T00:39:50.564Z","0.14.0":"2015-09-03T18:33:07.923Z","0.13.1":"2015-08-04T19:11:28.289Z","0.13.0":"2015-06-03T19:19:34.249Z","0.12.0":"2015-05-29T03:10:34.443Z","0.11.1":"2015-05-08T22:38:57.622Z","0.11.0":"2015-01-30T07:36:52.033Z","0.10.0":"2015-01-27T19:20:44.987Z","0.9.0":"2014-12-09T19:20:59.877Z","0.8.0":"2014-12-04T19:39:17.182Z","0.7.0":"2014-10-22T19:10:51.138Z","0.6.0":"2014-10-06T02:28:39.725Z","0.5.1":"2014-08-27T17:10:08.431Z","0.5.0":"2013-09-08T16:05:25.774Z","0.4.0":"2013-06-17T03:07:44.494Z","0.3.2":"2013-04-09T13:56:31.752Z","0.3.1":"2013-03-08T04:20:31.182Z","0.3.0":"2013-02-24T18:00:58.604Z","0.2.0":"2013-02-20T17:06:39.999Z","0.1.2":"2013-01-08T19:06:31.701Z","0.1.1":"2012-11-12T22:23:36.890Z","0.1.0":"2012-10-23T14:39:17.443Z","0.0.1":"2012-10-18T22:30:13.399Z"},"versions":{"0.15.0":{"name":"proxy-middleware","version":"0.15.0","description":"http(s)
